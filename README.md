# BLINK - central code repo

Set of matlab scripts for signal processing and classification.

These functions are used to treat an arbitrary recorded signal to extract information, and classify the signal into various classes using different approaches.

### Authors

Code and scripts by Edoardo D'Anna and Charles Vila.

### Functions
- **plot_fft.m**: a simple (but useful) function which allows any sampled signal to be fft'd and ploted.

- **original_plot_from_serial.m**: messy file which needs to be fixed which reads from serial, ffts and plots.

- **classify_edo.m**: simple classifier. Still old script. Needs to be gone through.

- **extract_frequency_features.m**: script to extract features based on breaking down the signal into frequency components. Still old script. Needs to be gone through.

- **plot_live_signal.m**: plots signal received from serial port live . Still old script. Needs to be gone through.

- **plot_power_spectrums.m**: plots the power spectrum of a given signal. Still old script. Needs to be gone through.
